## RP2040 Driver

A grblHAL driver for the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 processor on a [Pi Pico board](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).

This driver is currently [work in progress](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/discussions/206#discussioncomment-318652).

The board map/code for the PicoCNC has now been mostly verified with a prototype version and should soon be ready for prime time.

__Important__ download information can be found [here](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/wiki/Compiling-GrblHAL).

The default build environment is Visual Studio Code, it is surprisingly easy to set up on Raspberry Pi - see the [Getting started](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) documentation for how to for this and other platforms.
